  "summary": "The diff implements a 2-slide Hug Day slideshow with slide transitions, ambient heart/petal effects, and a music toggle. However, it appears to introduce Internet Identity/auth scaffolding (a non-goal) and does not provide evidence that the required generated image assets exist under the specified public path. There is also a mismatch with the required *exact* bottom-note text, and the text fade-in animation may not re-trigger on slide activation because slides remain mounted.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Show the exact bottom note text: “Cant hug u physically right now so sending u the virtual ones”.",
      "reason": "The implemented bottom note text differs from the required exact string (uses \"Can't\" instead of \"Cant\").",

      "requirement": "Fade-in animation for headline and bottom note when the slide appears, synchronized with the slide transition.",
      "reason": "Slides are all rendered at once (absolute-positioned) and the text uses a static CSS animation class. With no remount or active-state-driven keying, the fade-in may only run on initial page load rather than each time a slide becomes active.",
